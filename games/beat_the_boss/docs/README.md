# Boxing Casino Game - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to create a boxing-themed casino game using Stake Engine's math SDK. The game maps traditional boxing moves and sequences to casino "paylines" while maintaining proven RTP and volatility controls.

## Key Innovation: Boxing Moves as Paylines

Instead of traditional slot symbols and paylines, our game uses:
- **Boxing Moves** = Slot Symbols (FWD, BWD, PUN, UPP, DUK, HRT, DIZ, KO)
- **Move Sequences** = Paylines (e.g., "DUK-DUK-UPP-KO" = perfect counter combo)
- **Health Bars** = Dynamic multiplier modifiers
- **Fight Rounds** = Spin cycles with cascade mechanics

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Boxing Moves (Symbols)
```python
# Each move has different probability weights and effects
MOVES = {
    "FWD": {"type": "positioning", "risk": "low", "damage": 0},
    "BWD": {"type": "defensive", "risk": "low", "damage": 0},
    "PUN": {"type": "attack", "risk": "medium", "damage": 10},
    "UPP": {"type": "power_attack", "risk": "high", "damage": 25},
    "DUK": {"type": "dodge", "risk": "low", "damage": 0, "bonus": "multiplier_preserve"},
    "HRT": {"type": "damage_taken", "risk": "penalty", "damage": -15},
    "DIZ": {"type": "stunned", "risk": "penalty", "damage": -10},
    "KO":  {"type": "finisher", "risk": "ultimate", "damage": 100}
}
```

### 2. Winning Sequences (Paylines)

#### Basic Combinations (Common, 1.5x - 5x)
- `FWD-PUN` - Forward punch combo (1.5x)
- `PUN-PUN` - Double jab (2x)
- `BWD-PUN` - Counter punch (2.5x)
- `FWD-UPP` - Power uppercut (5x)

#### Advanced Combinations (Uncommon, 8x - 20x)
- `PUN-PUN-UPP` - Combo uppercut (8x)
- `DUK-UPP` - Perfect counter (12x)
- `BWD-DUK-FWD-UPP` - Matrix combo (20x)

#### Legendary Sequences (Rare, 50x - 5000x)
- `DUK-KO` - Counter knockout (50x)
- `DUK-DUK-UPP-KO` - Perfect defense combo (100x)
- `DUK-DUK-DUK-UPP-KO` - The Perfect Fight (5000x) - *Ultimate jackpot*

### 3. Health-Based Multipliers

The boxing theme creates natural multiplier scaling:

```python
def calculate_health_multiplier(player_health, opponent_health):
    multiplier = 1.0
    
    # Desperation bonus (low health = higher risk/reward)
    if player_health < 25:
        multiplier *= 1.5
    elif player_health < 50:
        multiplier *= 1.2
        
    # Healthy fighter bonus
    if player_health > 75:
        multiplier *= 1.2
        
    # Opponent vulnerability bonus
    if opponent_health < 30:
        multiplier *= 1.5  # Easier to finish
        
    return multiplier
```

## Stake Engine Integration

### 1. BetMode Configuration

We create four distinct betting modes that appeal to different player types:

#### Standard Mode (1x bet)
- **Target Audience**: Casual players
- **RTP**: 96%
- **Volatility**: Medium
- **Max Win**: 5000x
- **Hit Rate**: ~65% (wins + small wins)

#### Aggressive Mode (2x bet) 
- **Target Audience**: High-risk players
- **RTP**: 96% (same RTP, higher volatility)
- **Volatility**: High
- **Max Win**: 5000x
- **Hit Rate**: ~40% (fewer wins, bigger payouts)

#### Defensive Mode (0.5x bet)
- **Target Audience**: Conservative players  
- **RTP**: 96%
- **Volatility**: Low
- **Max Win**: 500x (capped for lower variance)
- **Hit Rate**: ~75% (frequent small wins)

#### Championship Mode (100x bet)
- **Target Audience**: VIP players
- **RTP**: 96%
- **Guaranteed**: Minimum 50x win
- **Special**: Access to exclusive sequences

### 2. Distribution System

```python
# Example distribution for Standard Mode
distributions = [
    # Perfect Fight (0.01% chance, 5000x payout)
    Distribution(
        criteria="perfect_fight",
        quota=0.0001,
        win_criteria=5000.0,
        conditions={
            "sequence_requirements": ["DUK-DUK-DUK-UPP-KO"],
            "health_conditions": {"dodge_all": True},
            "force_wincap": True,
        }
    ),
    
    # Knockout wins (0.2% chance, 100x+ payout)
    Distribution(
        criteria="knockout", 
        quota=0.002,
        win_criteria=100.0,
        conditions={
            "knockout_sequences": ["UPP-KO", "DUK-KO"],
            "force_freegame": True,
        }
    ),
    
    # Standard wins, losses, etc...
]
```

## Frontend Integration (Stake Web SDK)

The boxing game can use Stake's Web SDK for rich visual presentation:

### 1. Visual Components
```javascript
// Example Svelte component structure
<script>
    import { StakeEngine } from '@stakeengine/web-sdk';
    
    let fighterHealth = 100;
    let opponentHealth = 100;
    let currentSequence = [];
    let multiplier = 1.0;
    
    // Handle move events from backend
    function handleMoveEvent(event) {
        currentSequence.push(event.move);
        fighterHealth = event.playerHealth;
        opponentHealth = event.opponentHealth;
        
        // Animate fighter actions
        animateFighterMove(event.move);
    }
</script>

<div class="boxing-ring">
    <div class="fighter player" health={fighterHealth}>
        <!-- Player fighter animation -->
    </div>
    
    <div class="fighter opponent" health={opponentHealth}>  
        <!-- Opponent fighter animation -->
    </div>
    
    <div class="hud">
        <div class="health-bar player">
            <div class="health-fill" style="width: {fighterHealth}%"></div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="sequence-display">
            Current Combo: {currentSequence.join(' → ')}
        </div>
        
        <div class="multiplier">
            {multiplier.toFixed(1)}x
        </div>
        
        <div class="health-bar opponent">
            <div class="health-fill" style="width: {opponentHealth}%"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Animation System
- **Move Animations**: Each boxing move triggers specific fighter animations
- **Health Bar Updates**: Real-time health depletion with damage numbers
- **Combo Indicators**: Visual feedback for building sequences  
- **Knockout Effects**: Dramatic animations for KO sequences
- **Multiplier Meter**: Building excitement as multipliers increase

## RTP and Volatility Analysis

### Expected Return Distribution
```
Loss (0x):           35% - Balanced loss rate
Small Wins (0.1-2x): 35% - Frequent engagement
Medium Wins (2-10x):  20% - Regular excitement  
Big Wins (10-100x):   4.5% - Significant payouts
Major Wins (100-1000x): 0.49% - Rare but meaningful
Jackpot (1000-5000x):  0.01% - Ultimate prize
```

### Volatility Comparison
| Mode | Hit Rate | Avg Win | Max Streak Loss | Volatility |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Defensive | 75% | 1.8x | 8 spins | Low |
| Standard | 65% | 2.4x | 12 spins | Medium |
| Aggressive | 40% | 4.2x | 25 spins | High |
| Championship | 100% | 50x+ | N/A | Premium |
