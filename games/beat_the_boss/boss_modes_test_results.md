## Analysis

### Root Cause
The game uses a **single shared paytable** for all three boss modes, but each mode has:
1. Different bet costs (1x, 2x, 3x)
2. Different reel distributions
3. Different max win targets

The current implementation does NOT scale the paytable values based on bet cost, causing:
- Putin mode (2x cost) to pay out 214% RTP instead of 98%
- Trump mode (3x cost) to pay out 119% RTP instead of 98%

### Reel Distribution Comparison

**Macron (Defensive) - macron_base.csv:**
- BWD: 25 (defensive positioning)
- DUK: 20 (dodging)
- FWD: 20 (forward movement)
- PUN: 20 (basic attack)
- UPP: 10 (power attack)
- HRT: 3 (damage taken)
- DIZ: 2 (stunned)
- KO: 1 (knockout)
Total: 101 symbols

**Putin (Balanced) - putin_base.csv:**
- FWD: 25 (aggressive positioning)
- PUN: 25 (frequent basic attacks)
- BWD: 15 (moderate defense)
- DUK: 15 (moderate dodging)
- UPP: 10 (power attacks)
- HRT: 5 (more damage taken)
- DIZ: 3 (more stuns)
- KO: 2 (more knockout opportunities)
Total: 100 symbols

**Trump (Aggressive) - trump_base.csv:**
- FWD: 30 (maximum forward pressure)
- PUN: 30 (maximum basic attacks)
- UPP: 20 (frequent power attacks)
- BWD: 10 (minimal defense)
- DUK: 5 (minimal dodging)
- HRT: 3 (moderate damage)
- DIZ: 1 (rare stuns)
- KO: 1 (rare knockout)
Total: 100 symbols

### Key Insights

1. **Putin Mode** has a more balanced distribution but higher RTP (214%) because:
   - More KO symbols (2 vs 1 in Macron)
   - More forward/offensive moves (FWD+PUN = 50 vs 40 in Macron)
   - The reel distribution creates more winning combinations
   - The paytable is NOT adjusted for the 2x bet cost

2. **Trump Mode** has lower RTP (119%) despite aggressive reels because:
   - Heavy on basic moves (FWD+PUN = 60 symbols)
   - Lower defensive moves mean fewer combo opportunities
   - Still higher than target 98% due to no bet cost adjustment

3. **Hit Rates** are very similar (98-99%) across all modes, which suggests the reel distributions are creating consistent winning patterns, but the win amounts are not properly scaled.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Mode-Specific Paytables (Recommended)
Create separate paytables for each mode that account for bet cost:

```python
self.paytable_macron = {
    # Current paytable values (1x cost)
}

self.paytable_putin = {
    # Adjusted paytable (divide by ~2.18 to achieve 98% RTP)
    (2, "FWD-PUN"): 0.0002,  # was 0.0005
    (2, "PUN-PUN"): 0.0002,  # was 0.0005
    # ... etc
}

self.paytable_trump = {
    # Adjusted paytable (divide by ~1.22 to achieve 98% RTP)
    (2, "FWD-PUN"): 0.0004,  # was 0.0005
    (2, "PUN-PUN"): 0.0004,  # was 0.0005
    # ... etc
}
```

### Option 2: Dynamic Cost Scaling (Alternative)
Modify `calculate_sequence_win()` to apply cost multiplier:

```python
def calculate_sequence_win(self, sequence, base_multiplier, length):
    # Get bet mode cost
    current_mode = self.get_current_betmode()
    bet_cost = current_mode.get_cost()

    # Scale multiplier by cost (inverted)
    # For 2x cost, multiply by 0.5
    # For 3x cost, multiply by 0.33
    multiplier = base_multiplier / bet_cost

    # ... rest of function
```

### Option 3: Reel Weight Adjustments
Adjust the reel distributions to naturally achieve 98% RTP:
- Reduce KO symbols in Putin mode
- Reduce offensive move frequency
- Increase losing symbol combinations

**Note**: This is the most complex option and requires iterative testing.

## Verification Status

### Reel Files Status
All reel CSV files are present and correctly formatted:
- ✓ macron_base.csv (101 symbols)
- ✓ macron_round.csv
- ✓ putin_base.csv (100 symbols)
- ✓ putin_round.csv
- ✓ trump_base.csv (100 symbols)
- ✓ trump_round.csv

### Code Implementation Status
- ✓ Game correctly reads different reels per mode
- ✓ Bet costs are configured (1x, 2x, 3x)
- ✗ Paytable values not adjusted for bet cost
- ✗ Win calculation doesn't scale by bet cost

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement Option 2 (Dynamic Cost Scaling) as a quick fix
2. **Short-term**: Create mode-specific paytables (Option 1) for fine-tuned control
3. **Testing**: Re-run bypass tests after implementation
4. **Validation**: Verify all modes achieve ~98% RTP
5. **Distribution Testing**: Test with full distribution system enabled

## Test Commands

```bash
# Macron mode test
python bypass_test.py

# Putin mode test
python bypass_test_putin.py

# Trump mode test
python bypass_test_trump.py
```

## Expected Results After Fix

| Mode   | Cost | RTP Target | Hit Rate Target | Max Win |
|--------|------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| Macron | 1x   | 98%        | ~70%            | 5000x   |
| Putin  | 2x   | 98%        | ~50%            | 7500x   |
| Trump  | 3x   | 98%        | ~35%            | 10000x   |

**Note**: Current hit rates (98-99%) are much higher than targets due to no distribution system filtering. With proper distribution implementation, hit rates should align with target volatility profiles.
