# Beat the Boss - Boss Modes Test Summary

## Executive Summary

Testing of Putin and Trump boss modes reveals that **the reel distributions need adjustment** to achieve the target 98% RTP. The bet cost scaling has been implemented correctly, but the different symbol frequencies in each mode's reels create different win patterns.

## Test Results - BEFORE Fix

### Initial Test (No Cost Scaling)
| Mode   | Cost | RTP      | Hit Rate | Max Win    | Status |
|--------|------|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| Macron | 1x   | 98.00%   | 99.56%   | N/A        | ✓ OK   |
| Putin  | 2x   | 214.15%  | 98.40%   | 5660.25x   | ✗ TOO HIGH |
| Trump  | 3x   | 119.47%  | 99.10%   | 5660.25x   | ✗ TOO HIGH |

**Problem**: Paytable values were not adjusted for bet cost, causing Putin (2x) and Trump (3x) modes to pay out at much higher rates than intended.

## Test Results - AFTER Fix

### Current Test (With Cost Scaling)
| Mode   | Cost | RTP      | Hit Rate | Max Win    | Status |
|--------|------|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| Macron | 1x   | 98.00%   | 99.56%   | N/A        | ✓ OK   |
| Putin  | 2x   | 107.07%  | 98.40%   | 2830.12x   | ✗ STILL HIGH |
| Trump  | 3x   | 39.82%   | 99.10%   | 1886.75x   | ✗ TOO LOW |

**Progress**: Cost scaling has been implemented and is working. Putin improved from 214% to 107%, Trump decreased from 119% to 40%.

**Remaining Issue**: The reel symbol distributions create different win frequencies that aren't balanced by cost scaling alone.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Putin is Still High (107% vs 98% target)

**Putin's reel distribution** (`putin_base.csv`):
- More KO symbols: 2 (vs 1 in Macron) → More big wins
- More offensive symbols: FWD+PUN = 50 (vs 40 in Macron) → More frequent combos
- More balanced distribution → Creates more winning combinations

**Effect**: Even with 2x cost scaling (dividing wins by 2), the increased win frequency from better reel distribution still pushes RTP above target.

### Why Trump is Too Low (40% vs 98% target)

**Trump's reel distribution** (`trump_base.csv`):
- Heavy on basic moves: FWD (30) + PUN (30) = 60 symbols
- High UPP count: 20 (vs 10 in Macron) → Should create more wins
- Low defensive moves: DUK (5) + BWD (10) = 15 only

**Effect**: The 3x cost scaling (dividing wins by 3) is too aggressive when combined with Trump's reel distribution, which doesn't create proportionally more wins.

## Reel Distribution Comparison

### Symbol Frequencies

| Symbol | Macron | Putin | Trump | Description |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| FWD    | 20     | 25    | 30    | Forward movement (positioning) |
| PUN    | 20     | 25    | 30    | Basic punch attack |
| BWD    | 25     | 15    | 10    | Backward movement (defense) |
| DUK    | 20     | 15    | 5     | Duck/dodge (defense) |
| UPP    | 10     | 10    | 20    | Uppercut (power attack) |
| HRT    | 3      | 5     | 3     | Hurt (damage taken) |
| DIZ    | 2      | 3     | 1     | Dizzy (stunned) |
| KO     | 1      | 2     | 1     | Knockout (finisher) |
| **Total** | **101** | **100** | **100** | |

### Key Insights

1. **Macron (Defensive)**: Balanced between offense and defense, naturally achieves 98% RTP
2. **Putin (Balanced)**: More aggressive than Macron, creates ~9% more wins than intended
3. **Trump (Aggressive)**: Heavy offense but poor combo variety, creates ~60% fewer wins than intended

## Recommended Solutions

### Option A: Adjust Reel Distributions (Recommended)

**For Putin Mode** - Reduce win frequency:
- Reduce KO from 2 to 1 (match Macron)
- Reduce PUN from 25 to 22
- Increase BWD from 15 to 18
- Target: Bring RTP from 107% down to 98%

**For Trump Mode** - Increase win frequency:
- Keep aggressive style but improve combo potential
- Increase KO from 1 to 2
- Reduce FWD from 30 to 25 (still aggressive)
- Increase DUK from 5 to 10 (enable duck-based combos)
- Target: Bring RTP from 40% up to 98%

### Option B: Mode-Specific Paytable Multipliers

Add a mode-specific RTP adjustment factor:

```python
self.mode_rtp_adjustment = {
    "macron": 1.0,    # 98% base
    "putin": 0.915,   # Reduce by 8.5% (107% → 98%)
    "trump": 2.46,    # Increase by 146% (40% → 98%)
}

# In calculate_sequence_win():
multiplier = (base_multiplier / bet_cost) * mode_rtp_adjustment[mode_name]
```

This is quick but feels like a band-aid solution.

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best Long-term)

1. Adjust reels moderately (Option A)
2. Add minor paytable tweaks for fine-tuning
3. Run iterative testing until all modes hit 98% ± 1%

## Implementation Status

### Completed ✓
- [x] Created bypass test scripts for all three modes
- [x] Identified RTP discrepancies (214%, 119% before fix)
- [x] Implemented bet cost scaling in `game_override.py`
- [x] Verified Macron mode still works correctly (98%)
- [x] Created comprehensive test results documentation

### Remaining ✗
- [ ] Adjust Putin reel distribution to reduce RTP from 107% to 98%
- [ ] Adjust Trump reel distribution to increase RTP from 40% to 98%
- [ ] Re-test after reel adjustments
- [ ] Validate max win values are reachable (7500x Putin, 10000x Trump)
- [ ] Test with distribution system enabled (not just bypass)

## Code Changes Made

### File: `/Users/kmcbride/Documents/GitHub/se-beat_the_boss_math/math-sdk/games/beat_the_boss/game_override.py`

**Change**: Added bet cost scaling to `calculate_sequence_win()` method

```python
def calculate_sequence_win(self, sequence, base_multiplier, length):
    """Calculate win amount - using base multiplier scaled by bet cost."""
    # Get bet mode cost to scale the paytable
    current_mode = self.get_current_betmode()
    bet_cost = current_mode.get_cost()

    # Scale multiplier by cost (inverted)
    # For 1x cost (Macron): multiply by 1.0
    # For 2x cost (Putin): multiply by 0.5
    # For 3x cost (Trump): multiply by 0.33
    multiplier = base_multiplier / bet_cost

    # ... rest of function
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for 98% RTP)

1. **Adjust Putin Reels** (`putin_base.csv`):
   ```
   Reduce KO: 2 → 1
   Reduce PUN: 25 → 22
   Increase BWD: 15 → 18
   ```

2. **Adjust Trump Reels** (`trump_base.csv`):
   ```
   Increase KO: 1 → 2
   Reduce FWD: 30 → 25
   Increase DUK: 5 → 10
   ```

3. **Re-run Tests**:
   ```bash
   python bypass_test_putin.py
   python bypass_test_trump.py
   ```

4. **Iterate Until Target Met**: Adjust reels incrementally until both modes hit 98% ± 1%

### Short-term (Validation)

1. Test with distribution system enabled
2. Verify hit rates match targets (50% Putin, 35% Trump)
3. Confirm max wins are achievable (7500x, 10000x)
4. Run full simulation with all distributions

### Long-term (Polish)

1. Optimize round reel sets (macron_round.csv, etc.)
2. Add health-based bonuses back in
3. Fine-tune volatility profiles
4. Player experience testing

## Conclusion

**Putin and Trump modes are now partially working** with bet cost scaling implemented correctly. However, **reel distribution adjustments are required** to achieve the target 98% RTP for both modes.

The reel files (`putin_base.csv` and `trump_base.csv`) are correctly being loaded and used by the game, as evidenced by the different RTP values. The remaining work is to tune these reel distributions through iterative testing until the target RTP is reached.

**Current Status**:
- ✓ Macron: 98% RTP (perfect)
- ⚠️ Putin: 107% RTP (needs -9% adjustment)
- ⚠️ Trump: 40% RTP (needs +58% adjustment)

**Recommended Action**: Adjust reel distributions per Option A above, then re-test.
